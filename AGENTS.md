# Codument Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/codument/std/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals or tracks (words like proposal, spec, change, plan, track, implement)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding
- 用户提出的补充需求，属于当前进行中的某个track范围

Use `@/codument/std/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'codument update' can refresh the instructions.
