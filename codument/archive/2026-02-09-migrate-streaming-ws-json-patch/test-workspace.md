# Local Test Workspace

This track may need end-to-end verification against a real local workspace directory.

## Approved local workspace path

The user approved using the following local directory as a workspace for manual QA or ad-hoc E2E runs:

- `E:\\tmp\\kunun.ts`

## Notes

- This is for local verification only. Automated tests committed to the repo MUST NOT require this path to exist.
- Any files created/modified under this directory should be treated as local-only artifacts and MUST NOT be committed.
